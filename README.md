# CarlsTerrariaRipoff

As stated in the name, this is a rip off of the popular game Terraria, which is also my favorite game.
It uses Raylib as its only library so i dont have to feel pain trying to render stuff with opengl.

This is simply for learning porpuse, so i can deepen my understanding of C and my C programming skills.

My goals for this project is a semi functioning Terraria game with world generation,
worlds stored in files,
perhaps a startgame ui,
and some basic functions like crafting and mining,
and perhaps multiplayer with websockets, so i can run terraria mulitplayer on the web.
